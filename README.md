*Caesar Cipher*

This is a basic Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.


Features:

Encrypts a message by shifting letters forward by a specified amount.
Decrypts a message by shifting letters backward using the same shift value.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation) are not affected by the shift.


How to Use:

1.Clone the repository or download the code.

2.Run the caesar_cipher.py program.

3.Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.

4.Input the message and the shift value (number of positions to shift).

5.The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message.
